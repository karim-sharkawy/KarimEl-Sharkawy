							<h1>Maths</h1>

						<h2>The intersection of math with other subjects</h2>
						<p>For one to care about and study math and the environment, encountering
						<a href = "https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMiNCvvSotv0vA90Z9WOBMsRnYjOSf4Mi&si=f6ETaacG9dneDxe6">ecological economics (EE)</a> is only natural. I enjoy learning
						EE considers the environment in the economic cycle. A small, yet powerful change. As a side interest, I enjoy watching
						lectures on economic and environmental public policy.</p>
						<p>After studying linear algebra for a while, I've captured an interest in electrical engineering through continued exposure. 
							This has led me to study estimation theory, Z transforms, Laplace transforms, and Fourier series transforms.
						</p>
						<p>I enjoy learning and talking about the philosophy of math, the link between math and languages, and the history of mathematics.
							I will be reading "Mathematics as Metaphor" by Yuri Manin, Triangle of Thought by Alain Connes, 
								David Mumford's <a href = "https://www.dam.brown.edu/people/mumford/blog.html">blog</a>, and listening 
								to Alain Connes' <a href = "https://alainconnes.org/category/conversations/">podcasts</a>.
							I'm also interested in "Stabilité structurelle et morphogenèse René Thom".

                    <h1>Environmentalism</h1>
                    <p>
                        Humans have a moral responsibility to safeguard the environment and uphold its rights. There should be an emphasis on treating the environment with care and compassion, recognizing the worth of 
                        every living creature. This stewardship and kindness towards animals reflects a comprehensive approach to environmental ethics. My intention is to highlight factors contributing to environmental/social problems. 
                        I recommend reading Environmental Ethics by Gregory Bassham. Despite my disagreements with the book, it's a good introduction to environmentalism's perspectives. Naturally, everyone's motivations
                        are different, but our overall goal should be the same.
                    </p>

						<h2>Consumption</h2>
						<p>I'm a firm believer that the global population count doesn't matter, and that to achieve results, we need to consume less. Countries like Germany, Japan, 
							the US, Saudi Arabia, and others overconsume food, electricity, and other resources, often to the disadvantage of poorer countries like Pakistan, Haiti, 
							Bangladesh, etc. In my food consumption <a href = "docs/Population & Food Consumption.pdf">presentation</a>, I explain why food consumption is a problem. I 
							focused on food because of my experiences working in dining courts and seeing the huge amount of food waste.</p>
					</header>

					<header>
						<h2>Climate Change Adaptation & Mitigation</h2>
						<p>
							Both climate change mitigation and adaptation are important, but they're more practical for some communities depending on their situations. 
							In our climate change adaptation <a href="docs/adapting_to_extreme_heat.pdf">presentation</a> my groupmates gave in our scientific issues course, we spoke about adapting to climate change 
							in Tucson, Arizona and possible (small and large) strategies that the community and individual persons can adapt.

                    <h1>Languages</h1>
                    <!-- <blockquote> Oh humanity! Indeed, We created you from a male and a female, and made you into peoples and tribes so that you may ˹get to˺ 
                        know one another. Surely the most noble of you in the sight of Allah is the most righteous among you. Allah is truly All-Knowing, All-Aware. </blockquote> -->
                    <p> <!-- From one of my most cherished chapters, it teaches that God crafted humanity with diverse skin tones and unique traits, 
                        promoting the rejection of racism and emphasizing superiority through righteousness alone. Moreover, it implies to me 
                        that God designed us all to foster understanding among one another. --> I believe one of the most effective means of understanding 
                        others is through learning their language. By mastering a language, you integrate into that community in a way that's unparalleled. 
                        However, this is merely a hobby of mine; I'm not engaged in any formal research in this area.</p>
                    <h2>Language Endangerment & Extinction</h2>

                                <!-- Main -->
                                <div id="main">
                                    <div id = "#intro" class="inner">

                                                <h3>Sprachen Karte</h3>
                                                <p>I created a interactive languages visualization tool called <a href = "https://karim-sharkawy.github.io/SprachenKarte/map.html">Sprachen Karte</a>.
                                                    It parses every language in Ethnologue and puts them on a map. The point here is to get
                                                    an understanding of the number of endangered and extinct languages along with their characteristics.
                                                    I also created different graphs which show the geographical differences between languages and their
                                                    vitality along with several statistics.
                                                </p>
                                                <ul class="actions">

                    <p>Linguist K. David Harrison's great book <em>When Languages Die</em>, which discusses the crisis facing languages, notes that approximately half of the world's 7,000 languages 
                        are likely to disappear by the end of this century. There's also a great <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nmLYo8zQOVs">interview</a> with him discussing the book.
                        The <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7HZOsQYx_U&list=WL&index=3">TedxTalk</a> by Mandana Seyfeddinipur, where she also mentions 
                        the <a href = "https://www.elararchive.org/">endangered languages archive</a>. Harrison emphasizes the 
                        importance and responsibility of documenting and preserving endangered languages, which contain valuable historical, mythological, and scientific knowledge. He also stresses 
                        the significance of supporting language revitalization efforts and acknowledging the vast indigenous knowledge embedded within these languages. The video below is a great 
                        introduction to the topic.</p>
