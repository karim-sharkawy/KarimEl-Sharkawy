									<h1>Current Projects & Learning</h1>

									<p>
										I have been refining my skills in machine learning and data science to address these issues effectively. Naturally, I am also 
										enhancing my knowledge of mathematics, particularly in computational and numerical methods. I am working on an environmental 
										data science project to improve my data science skills and enter the Environmental Data Science (EDS) field. I am creating a climate
										climate prediction tool for West Lafayette, Indiana, taking into account climate change.
									</p>

									<p>
										I am learning applied linear algebra, with some machine learning and data science techniques via programs 
										and personal projects‚Äã. I'm reading <a href ="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf">Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra</a>
										by Stephen Boyd and ‚ÄãLieven Vandenberghe. I try to include a mix of probability theory, statistical analysis, 
										and environmental & Atmospheric data analysis in my personal projects.

                            <p>Along with my colleagues under the supervision of <a href = "https://www.math.purdue.edu/~tsincla/">Professor Thomas Sinclair</a>, I'm investigating positive mappings and their extensions. 
								We are working on a paper that has established a thorough groundwork for understanding positive mappings and their lifts via the untanglement mapping, ùúè. The paper demonstrates the 
								essential properties of ùúè and the matrix representations of ùúè and its inverse, revealing their influence on positive mappings. Finally, the paper 
								presents and proves the Untanglement Theorem, which asserts that a positive lifting exists if and only if the map can be untangled, thus exploring its implications in lifting positive 
								maps. The code can be found in the GitHub and draws on a blend of disciplines including linear programming, optimization, and machine learning (particularly SVMs). We developed methods 
								to create, classify, and visualize the mappings.</p>
								<p>We proved Farkas' lemma using and connecting to the hyperplane separation theorem (<a href="docs/farkas.pdf">proof</a>) and developed methods to verify classifiers to distinguish between
									liftable and nonliftable maps. Furthermore, we acquired insights into positive mappings and how to make them extend in our paper.</p>

										<h3>Martian Climate Research</h3>
										<p>During my time at Purdue Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), I contributed to a research project on Martian climate alongside 
											Audrey Durham and Benjamin Carpenter, under the guidance of <a href = "https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/people/profile/wanglei.html">Professor Lei Wang</a> and graduate student Zhaoyu Liu. My research focused on understanding 
											Mars' climate through the study of annular modes using the EMARS and MACDA datasets, drawing comparisons to Earth's atmospheric dynamics. I engaged 
											in extensive literature review, data analysis using netCDF formats and Python, and regular collaborative meetings. Additionally, I prepared and 
											presented my research interests to my lab and submitted an abstract to AGU and participating in various workshops.
                                        </p>

										<p> One of my key moments of growth was studying the periodic variability in Mars' storm tracks and their relationship with dust events, identifying significant 
											midlatitude eddy activity influenced by the southern hemisphere's topography. I understood the importance of annular modes in Mars' and Titan's atmospheres, 
											revealing parallels with Earth's atmospheric behavior. This was a paper written by <a href="https://battalio.com/">Michael Battalio</a>, who I was mentored by for a short time. 
											Participating in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Bootcamp further enriched my understanding of critical atmospheric concepts like Rossby waves, 
											vorticity, baroclinic instability, and Quasi-geostrophic models. These efforts contribute to my broader goal of advancing planetary climate research and 
											developing a long-term research career in this field.
                                        </p>
											
										<p> I read some of Adam Showman's Atmospheric Circulation of Exoplanets to serve as my introduction to atmospheric dynamics and exoplanetary atmospheres. I also 
											dipped my toes into the works of Wanying Kang's articles and Professor Dennis Hartmann's notes on objective analysis.</p>

								<p>‚ÄãAmong my many role models, Professors <a href = "https://www.math.purdue.edu/~snariman/">Sam Nariman<a/> & <a href = "https://www.math.purdue.edu/~tsincla/">Thomas Sinclair</a>
									are perhaps the most influential. Professor Nariman's mentorship ignited my passion for linear algebra and revealed its profound beauty. Through his guidance in Linear Algebra II, 
									I discovered an affinity for a subject I once found daunting. Professor Sinclair's mentorship throughout my undergraduate research has shaped me into a self-improving mathematician.
									Lubna of C√≥rdoba, a renowned mathematician and intellectual 
									leader of Andalusia, also inspires me with her excellence in math and stewardship of numerous libraries. I draw further inspiration from L√°szl√≥ Lempert, Roger Heath-Brown, 
									and Maryam Mirzakhani, whose remarkable achievements and dedication enrich my journey.</p>

								<p>
									<a href = "https://www.eaps.purdue.edu/people/profile/wanglei.html">Professor Lei Wang</a> is another key influence, motivating me to delve into atmospheric dynamics and exoplanetary research. 
									His guidance throughout my first research experience taught me how to be a researcher and read scientific papers with a keen eye. Moreover, he introduced me to many key figures in the atmospheric
									dynamics community. I also admire Adam Showman and Claire Monteleoni for their pioneering work in exoplanetary research and climate informatics, respectively. Dr. Monteleoni, through her 
									lectures, has introduced me to many subjects within computer science and environmental data science.
