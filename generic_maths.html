									<h1>Current Projects & Learning</h1>

									<p>
										I have been refining my skills in machine learning and data science to address these issues effectively. Naturally, I am also 
										enhancing my knowledge of mathematics, particularly in computational and numerical methods. I am working on an environmental 
										data science project to improve my data science skills and enter the Environmental Data Science (EDS) field. In this project,
									</p>

									<p>
										I am learning applied linear algebra, with some machine learning and data science techniques via programs 
										and personal projects​. I'm reading <a href ="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf">Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra</a>
										by Stephen Boyd and ​Lieven Vandenberghe. I try to include a mix of probability theory, statistical analysis, 
										and environmental & Atmospheric data analysis in my personal projects.

                            <p>I'm currently collaborating on a project titled "Notions of Positivity and Complexity in Quantum Information Theory" alongside Professor 
								Thomas Sinclair of Purdue Math, and colleagues Darshini Rajamani and Luke Luschwitz. Our research focuses on analyzing positive mappings (matrices) 
								and their extendibility, involving the development of an intricate code to evaluate specific matrix properties and visualize their cones.</p>

								<p>The code itself is a sophisticated algorithm that classifies and validates matrices based on mathematical criteria such as extendibility. 
								It draws on a blend of disciplines including linear algebra, optimization, linear programming, Euclidean distance geometry, and machine learning, 
								particularly SVM.</p>
								
								<p>Throughout this project, I've significantly enhanced my proficiency in Linear Algebra and Python, utilizing specialized libraries like NumPy 
									and Matplotlib. I've also gained exposure to fundamental machine learning techniques via Scikit-learn, along with acquiring essential Git skills.</p>

										<h3>Martian Climate Research</h3>
										<p>During my time at Purdue Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), I contributed to a research project on Martian climate alongside 
											Audrey Durham and Benjamin Carpenter, under the guidance of Professor Lei Wang and graduate student Zhaoyu Liu. My research focused on understanding 
											Mars' climate through the study of annular modes using the EMARS and MACDA datasets, drawing comparisons to Earth's atmospheric dynamics. I engaged 
											in extensive literature review, data analysis using netCDF formats and Python, and regular collaborative meetings. Additionally, I prepared and 
											presented my research interests to my lab and submitted an abstract to AGU and participating in various workshops.
                                        </p>

										<p> One of my key moments of growth was studying the periodic variability in Mars' storm tracks and their relationship with dust events, identifying significant 
											midlatitude eddy activity influenced by the southern hemisphere's topography. I understood the importance of annular modes in Mars' and Titan's atmospheres, 
											revealing parallels with Earth's atmospheric behavior. This was a paper written by Michael Battalio, who I eventually was mentored by for a short time. 
											Participating in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Bootcamp further enriched my understanding of critical atmospheric concepts like Rossby waves, 
											vorticity, baroclinic instability, and Quasi-geostrophic models. These efforts contribute to my broader goal of advancing planetary climate research and 
											developing a long-term research career in this field.
                                        </p>
											
										<p> I read some of Adam Showman's Atmospheric Circulation of Exoplanets to serve as my introduction to atmospheric dynamics and exoplanetary atmospheres. I also 
											dipped my toes into the works of Wanying Kang's articles and Professor Dennis Hartmann's notes on objective analysis.</p>

								<p>​Among my many role models, Professor Sam Nariman is perhaps the most influential. 
									His mentorship not only reignited my passion for math but also unveiled the beauty 
									of the subject in a profound manner. Through his guidance in his LA II class, I 
									discovered an affinity for linear algebra, a subject I once found daunting. Lubna 
									of Córdoba stands as another significant influence, epitomizing excellence in math 
									and intellectual leadership as a renowned mathematician of Andalusia and custodian of 
									numerous libraries. Additionally, I draw inspiration from László Lempert, Roger Heath-Brown, 
									and the legendary Maryam Mirzakhani, each enriching my journey with their remarkable achievements 
									and unwavering dedication.
                                </p>

								<p>
									Naturally, I have many role models, Lei Wang perhaps being the most influential. He motivated me to 
									continue learning and introduced me to atmospheric dynamics and exoplanetary research. I also look up 
									to Adam Showman and Claire Monteleoni because they're pioneers in the fields of exoplanetary research and 
									climate informatics respectively. Dr. Monteleoni especially has introduced me (through her lectures) to 
									many subjects within computer science and EDS.
