									<h1>Current Projects & Learning</h1>

									<p>
										I have been refining my skills in machine learning and data science to address these issues effectively. Naturally, I am also 
										enhancing my knowledge of mathematics, particularly in computational and numerical methods. I am working on an environmental 
										data science project to improve my data science skills and enter the Environmental Data Science (EDS) field. I am creating a climate
										climate prediction tool for West Lafayette, Indiana, taking into account climate change.
									</p>

									<p>
										I am learning applied linear algebra, with some machine learning and data science techniques via programs 
										and personal projects​. I'm reading <a href ="https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/vmls.pdf">Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra</a>
										by Stephen Boyd and ​Lieven Vandenberghe. I try to include a mix of probability theory, statistical analysis, 
										and environmental & Atmospheric data analysis in my personal projects.

                            <p>Along with my colleagues, I'm investigating positive mappings and their extensions on a project supervised by Professor Thomas Sinclair. We developed a code to determine how to classify them, 
				    properties of extendability, visualizations of their cones, and more. The code can be found in the GitHub and draws on a blend of disciplines including linear programming optimization and machine learning, 
								particularly SVMs.</p>
								<p>We proved Farkas' lemma using and connecting to the hyperplane separation theorem and developed methods to verify classifiers. Moreover, we 
								proved that positive matrices are always extendable and developed a corollary that no nonextendable matrices are nonnegative.</p>

										<h3>Martian Climate Research</h3>
										<p>During my time at Purdue Earth, Atmospheric, and Planetary Sciences (EAPS), I contributed to a research project on Martian climate alongside 
											Audrey Durham and Benjamin Carpenter, under the guidance of Professor Lei Wang and graduate student Zhaoyu Liu. My research focused on understanding 
											Mars' climate through the study of annular modes using the EMARS and MACDA datasets, drawing comparisons to Earth's atmospheric dynamics. I engaged 
											in extensive literature review, data analysis using netCDF formats and Python, and regular collaborative meetings. Additionally, I prepared and 
											presented my research interests to my lab and submitted an abstract to AGU and participating in various workshops.
                                        </p>

										<p> One of my key moments of growth was studying the periodic variability in Mars' storm tracks and their relationship with dust events, identifying significant 
											midlatitude eddy activity influenced by the southern hemisphere's topography. I understood the importance of annular modes in Mars' and Titan's atmospheres, 
											revealing parallels with Earth's atmospheric behavior. This was a paper written by Michael Battalio, who I eventually was mentored by for a short time. 
											Participating in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (GFD) Bootcamp further enriched my understanding of critical atmospheric concepts like Rossby waves, 
											vorticity, baroclinic instability, and Quasi-geostrophic models. These efforts contribute to my broader goal of advancing planetary climate research and 
											developing a long-term research career in this field.
                                        </p>
											
										<p> I read some of Adam Showman's Atmospheric Circulation of Exoplanets to serve as my introduction to atmospheric dynamics and exoplanetary atmospheres. I also 
											dipped my toes into the works of Wanying Kang's articles and Professor Dennis Hartmann's notes on objective analysis.</p>

								<p>​Among my many role models, Professor Sam Nariman is perhaps the most influential. His mentorship ignited my passion for linear algebra and revealed its profound beauty. 
									Through his guidance in Linear Algebra II, I discovered an affinity for a subject I once found daunting. Lubna of Córdoba, a renowned mathematician and intellectual 
									leader of Andalusia, also inspires me with her excellence in math and stewardship of numerous libraries. I draw further inspiration from László Lempert, Roger Heath-Brown, 
									and Maryam Mirzakhani, whose remarkable achievements and dedication enrich my journey.</p>

								<p>
									Lei Wang is another key influence, motivating me to delve into atmospheric dynamics and exoplanetary research. I also admire Adam Showman and Claire Monteleoni for 
									their pioneering work in exoplanetary research and climate informatics, respectively. Dr. Monteleoni, through her lectures, has introduced me to many subjects within 
									computer science and environmental data science.
