                    <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet! I'm an undergraduate at the Department of Mathematics at Purdue University, with a keen interest in applied mathematics and environmental data 
                        science. My passion lies at both seperate studies and their intersection, fueled by a deep commitment to sustainability. My ultimate goal is
                        to use applied/numerical linear algebra along with machine learning to address problems within maths and atmospheric studies.</p>

                    <p>My research and projects are aimed at maturing my mathematical abilities and achieving this goal. From developing innovative mathematical models 
                        to collaborating on interdisciplinary projects, I am dedicated to advancing knowledge and innovation in pursuit of a greener future.</p>

                    <p>But life isn't just about work, right? Beyond academia, I enjoy learning new languages, reading poetry, learning history, and running.
                    Have a wonderful day!</p>

                    <h2>Motivation</h2>
                    <blockquote>Indeed, God is beautiful and He loves beauty
                        - The Prophet Muhammad ï·º
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>
                        My love for mathematics is simply sustained by curiosity. It continues to surprise and delight me with its effectiveness and applications in nearly every field. There's something 
						truly magical about the process of learning math and discovering how to apply it. Each new concept feels like uncovering a hidden piece of a vast puzzle, bringing 
						me closer to understanding the intricate connections that weave through it. It was very surprising to me when I introspect and realized that my research field of linear algebra doesn't take 
						much time to get to. One could start researching it while still an undergrad and discover something for themselves.
						This journey is not just intellectually stimulating but also deeply fulfilling, 
						igniting a sense of wonder and awe in me. Perhaps the most amazing aspect of maths is how it starts with a few simple axioms, yet has blossomed into a language fueled by those
						willing enough to be uncomfortable and contemplate what no one has before.</p>
						
					<p>The environment is also an essential aspect of our daily lives. Its beauty is undeniable, yet each person sees something unique within 
						it. Some might marvel at the vibrant fish in the sea, while others might lose themselves exploring the depths of the Amazon rainforest. Despite these different perspectives, 
						we are all driven by a shared love for the environment. I am committed to preserving this precious environment for myself, future generations, and every living creature 
						on Earth. This quote from the Prophet Muhammad expresses my love for beauty and the pursuit of it. I see this beauty everywhere, especially in math and the environment. 
						This, along with my curiosity, drives me to explore, work on, and improve these fields with all my efforts.
